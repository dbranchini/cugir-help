  * Copies of the selected data file(s) in one of several [available formats](data-formats.md).
  * Descriptive [metadata](metadata.md) for the selected data file(s), in HTML and XML format.
  * A preview .png image representing a visualization of the data. 
For help extracting the contents of CUGIR zipped data packages, see the [Compressed Files](zip-file.md) help.
