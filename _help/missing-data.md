# *I need data that covers an area along the New York border, but can't find on your web site. Where I can get this data?*
Much of the data we receive for CUGIR comes from New York state agencies that are focused on  New York State. In some cases the data files are missing areas that fall outside of or along the state  borders. You may be able to find data covering these missing sections from neighboring states data repositories. A list of these can be found at [geolode.org](http://geolode.org/).
