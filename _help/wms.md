# WMS services from CUGIR

[WMS (Web Map Service)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms) is an open standard for serving georeferenced map images from
a geospatial dataset (unlike [WFS](wfs.md) which provides access to the features themselves).  Accessing these images from a WMS server via a web connected application makes it possible to visualize a data layer on a map without first having to download a data file. WMS also supports the ability to retrieve feature attributes, so that you can use the "Identify" tool to click a feature and view its associated information.

Many CUGIR data sets are made available as a WMS, via a *Web services* link displayed in the Tool section of each data page. While CUGIR does not provide support or advocate for any particular application, we have developed basic instructions for accessing our WMS layers via [QGIS](wms-qgis.md) and [ArcGIS](wms-arcgis.md).
