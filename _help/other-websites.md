# Other Websites with GIS Data

CUGIR focuses on geospatial data for New York State, as well as datasets created and commonly used by researchers at Cornell University.

Here are some other websites we recommend for data within New York State:

* [NYS GIS Clearinghouse](http://gis.ny.gov/)
* [NYS Orthos Online](https://orthos.dhses.ny.gov/) (imagery and elevation data)
* [Open Data NY](https://data.ny.gov/)
* [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

For even more sites, whether in New York, the United States, or around the globe:

* [Geolode](http://geolode.org/), a collaborative catalog of open geodata websites around the world
