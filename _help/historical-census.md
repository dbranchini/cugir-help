# *Where can I get U.S. Census data from years earlier than what CUGIR offers (or with different/additional attributes)?*
Potential sources of historical Census data include the [National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS)](http://www.nhgis.org/), the [Archive of Census Related Products (ACRP)](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/acrp), or the [U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/) site itself.
