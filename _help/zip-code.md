# *Do you have zip code data?*
CUGIR has zip code boundaries for [Tompkins County](http://cugir-dev.library.cornell.edu/catalog/002750) only. The census approximates zip code areas with their zip code tabulations areas (ZCTAs). ZCTAs can be downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau's [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html) website.
