# *What is Metadata?*
Metadata is descriptive information about a digital geospatial file, a common set of terms and definitions used when documenting geospatial data. Most digital geospatial files now have some associated metadata.  A metadata file answers the who, what, when, where, why and how questions about the data. CUGIR metadata is formatted according to [Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata) standards, available in html and xml formats.
