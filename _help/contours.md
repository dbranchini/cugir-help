# *Do you have contour maps/data (e.g. DLG)?*
CUGIR currently offers topographic contour data in a vector (shapefile) format for Tompkins County only, but you can generate contours from elevation data including DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) with some programs. Our Topographic Map data does include contour lines in a raster image format. Please consult the help or manuals for the software being used for assistance.
