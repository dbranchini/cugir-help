# *I am having trouble opening/using a .zip file. Can you help?*
Compressed files like .zip files need to be uncompressed before they can be viewed or imported into a GIS. You will need a file archiver application to do that. If your computer does not already have one installed [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_archivers) lists several, including a number of free ones.
