# *Where can I find aerial or satellite photos or images?*
CUGIR does not currently offer aerial photos or similar types of imagery. Sources for air photos and orthoimagery include:
* The __[New York State GIS Clearinghouse](http://gis.ny.gov/gateway/mg/)__ provides downloadable orthoimagery of New York State, as well as [Web Services](http://gis.ny.gov/gateway/mg/webserv/).

* The __[USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)__ offers the above and other imagery.

* Cornell University Library has __[New York State Historical Aerial Photographs](https://digital.library.cornell.edu/?f%5Bcollection_tesim%5D%5B%5D=New+York+State+Aerial+Photographs)__ for selected counties, going back to the 1930's.

* The __[USDA Aerial Photography Field Office](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/)__ offers aerial photos and orthoimagery, including [National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/) digital imagery. This and other imagery/data can be downloaded for free through the _[USDA Geospatial Data Gateway](https://gdg.sc.egov.usda.gov/)_. The most recent year of NAIP Imagery is available in [Web Mapping Services (WMS)](wms) format here: https://gis.apfo.usda.gov/arcgis/services, for direct access/viewing within compatible applications like ArcGIS.

* __County Farm Service Agency or Natural Resources Conservation Service offices__ sometimes have collections of air photos (click your  county for contact info): [http://offices.sc.egov.usda.gov/locator/app?state=ny&agency=fsa](http://offices.sc.egov.usda.gov/locator/app?state=ny&agency=fsa)

* The __[Global Land Cover Facility](http://www.landcover.org/) (GLCF)__ develops and distributes (for free) remotely sensed satellite data and products concerned with land cover from the local to global scales.

You can also try searching another site Mann Library maintains, [Geolode.org](http://geolode.org/), to search for other sources of geospatial data.
