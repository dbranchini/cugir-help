# *Do you have flood or other hazard related maps and data?*
We do not have flood or hazard related data in our repository. County-wide data are available from the [New York State GIS Clearinghouse](http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/inventories/details.cfm?DSID=246). Maps can also be viewed and ordered from the [FEMA Map Service](http://msc.fema.gov/). Portions of flood maps (called FIRMettes) can be extracted and saved for free from that site.
