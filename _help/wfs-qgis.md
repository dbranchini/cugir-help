## Accessing CUGIR WFS (Web Feature Services) using QGIS
<img align="left" src="images/QGIS_2.18.9_Add_WFS.png"> [QGIS](http://qgis.org) is a free and open source Geospatial Information System offering a number of enhanced capabilities, such as the ability to import and display various web services, including [WFS](wfs.md) layers. You can add a CUGIR WFS layer to a map in QGIS a number of ways, highlighted by the red arrows to the left (using QGIS 2.18.9 Desktop application). After clicking the appropriate WFS icon (right click the smaller one in the Browser Panel) or selecting *Layer>Add Layer>Add WFS*, name and enter the CUGIR WMS services URL (http://cugir.cornell.edu/geoserver/cugir/wfs) in the *Create a new WFS connection* dialogue box. 

NOTE: Though each data description page provides a *Web Services* link within its respective Tools menu, the URL for accessing those is the same for all CUGIR WFS layers. After creating a new connection in QGIS you will need to select the layer you wish to import/display on your map from the Browser Panel.
