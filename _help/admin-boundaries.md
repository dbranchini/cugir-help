# *Where can I find administrative boundary data (e.g. counties, towns, cities, municipalities)?*
The main source of administrative boundaries CUGIR offers at the statewide level is from the U.S. Census, including [County subdivisions](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_cousub.html) such as Minor Civil Divisions. CUGIR has a small collection of municipal boundary data limited to Tompkins County. Otherwise try contacting the local planning department for the area you are interested in.

You can download adminstrative boundary data (including [geospatial boundary files](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/)) directly from the [Census  Bureau](https://www.census.gov) as well. The [NYS GIS  Clearinghouse](http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/) also has boundary data. Some data sets are available only to members of the data cooperative, so you may need to contact the data owner directly. Cornell community members can use the [Contact CUGIR  form](http://cugir.library.cornell.edu/comments) to request  assistance from Mann Library in obtaining this data.
