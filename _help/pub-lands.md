# *I am looking for public lands boundary data. Do you have this?*
The [NYS GIS Clearinghouse](http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/) has some data on New York State public land boundaries. Some data sets are available only to members of the data cooperative, so  you may need to contact the data owner directly. Cornell community members can use the [CUGIR Contact form](http://cugir.library.cornell.edu/comments) to request assistance from Mann Library in obtaining this data. [Geolode](http://geolode.org/), a collaborative catalog of other geospatial data sources we help maintain may also be useful in finding desired data.
