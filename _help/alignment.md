# *Why don't my data layers line up properly?* #
Your problem may be related to an incorrect [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) or [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection) being applied to one or more data layers. Check the [metadata](metadata.md) for your data file(s) and confirm that your GIS application has applied the correct coordinate system/projection to those.
