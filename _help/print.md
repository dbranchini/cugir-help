# *How can I create a printable map on your website?*
While you can create a printable image by capturing a ["screenshot"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot) from the page displaying a particular CUGIR dataset, our website is not currently designed for that purpose. To create and print a proper map from CUGIR data customized for your needs you will need to download the data you want to map then use specialized GIS software. Many free applications exist. You can find lists of those from our [Data Formats](data-formats.md) help section.
