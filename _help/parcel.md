# *Can I get information or maps relating to property ownership (parcel), regulation and permits from CUGIR?* #
CUGIR does not have an extensive collection of [property](http://cugir-dev.library.cornell.edu/catalog?f%5Bcugir_category_sm%5D%5B%5D=property) related data sets associated with those topics (beyond a few for Tompkins County). Try contacting the planning agency for the county or local government you are interested in. The [NYS GIS Clearinghouse](https://gis.ny.gov/) offers parcel data for several New York State counties, and [NYS Office of Real Property Tax Services](https://www.tax.ny.gov/about/orpts/albany.htm) may also be helpful.
