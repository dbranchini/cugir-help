# Downloading data from CUGIR
<img align="left" src="images/CUGIR_download.png"> All [formats of data](data-formats.md) offered by CUGIR except for Web Services* can be downloaded from the page describing and displaying that particular dataset. On the upper right hand side of the page under Tools you will see a dropdown menu. If the format desired is already displayed (e.g. Download Shapefile, shown here), simply click that format name to start download process.

If you would like to download an alternate format (e.g. KMZ or GeoJSON), click the arrow from the dropdown menu and select (click) the appropriate option. You should see a green box appear below the menu providing a download link to that file.

*See the CUGIR [WMS](wms.md) and [WFS](wfs.md) Web Services help pages for accessing those.
