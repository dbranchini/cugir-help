# Data migration to new CUGIR website

The CUGIR website was first launched in the 1990s, back during a time when the Internet was young,
computers had less memory, and download speeds were much slower.  Consequently, many geospatial
datasets were distributed as multiple quad- or county-based downloads.  This required multiple
downloads in order to access data for larger areas.  When converting and migrating these datasets
to the new CUGIR infrastructure, we decided that on the modern Internet, a merged statewide file
of 8MB is no longer a "large" file.  So in many cases, such as US Census data, we took 62 county-
based files and merged them into a single statewide layer.
